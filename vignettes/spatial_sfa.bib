	to Farm Efficiency which is calculated by decomposing overall DEA
	Scores, by means of internalizing the positive and negative externalities

  abstract = {Ray (1998) has proposed a model for estimating scale efficiency using

	measure is obtained from the estimated parameters of the production

	study aims to estimate technical and scale efficiencies achieved
	by the Italian citrus fruit-growing farms. A stochastic frontier
	production model is considered in order to estimate technical and
	scale efficiencies. The analysis is expected to estimate the role
	of both technical and scale efficiencies in conditioning productivity.
	Particular attention is put on determining the (technical and scale)
	inefficiency effects associated with a set of structural and environmental
	variables that should affect efficiency and on the relationship between
	technical and scale efficiency scores. Empirical findings suggest
	that the greater portion of overall inefficiency in the sample might
	depend on producing below the production frontier than on operating
	under an inefficient scale. Indeed, room for improving technical
	efficiency is, on average, larger (29\%) than the margin due to scale
	inefficiency (18.2\%). Results also indicate a weak relationship
	between the two efficiency measures.},

	provides empirical evidence on the impact of the quality of political
	institutions and their modes of functioning on regulatory performance.
	The analysis finds that the impact of political accountability on

	Indicators based on physical inputs are calculated based on monetary

	about 4000 representative dairy farms. Results of SV are given in
	both absolute values and return-to-cost ratios which take farm size
	into account. Considering relationships between methods we found
	out that correlation between DEA and SV results are higher than 0.75.
	The indicator methods show correlations with the other approaches
	of more than 0.5 for economic indicators but a rather low correlation
	for ecological indicators. Further we identified characteristics
	of farms with high efficiency and sustainable performance. In order
	to show differences of used methods results are given by regions,
	size classes and orientation of production. Results indicate that
	bigger farms generate higher Sustainable Value. Farms in less favourable
	areas show a lower performance with regard to Sustainable Value and
	efficiency than farms located in other areas.},

	aspects by defining 12 indicators for Energy, Water, Soil, Biodiversity,
	Emission Potential, Plant Protection, Waste and Residues, Cash Flow,
	Farm Income, Investments, Local Economy and Social Situation. For
	each indicator a "State" (S) and a "Driving force" (D) are determined
	from direct measures of a number of parameters. The "State" indicates
	the current condition of the specific indicator, higher values are
	more desirable, and the "Driving force" is a measure of the estimated
	pressure the farming system places on the specific indicator; in
	this case lower values are desirable. D and S are standardized on
	a 0 to 100 scale; a perfect indicator would be identified by S=100
	and D=0, whereas significant challenges would be captured by a combination
	of a low S and a high D. The degree of sustainability (DS) of each
	indicator is defined as DS= (S-D), bound by construction to the -100
	to +100 range. The overall results are summarized and displayed in
	a sustainability polygon. In addition to this polygon a strength/weakness
	profile is determined for 1) the stability of the social, economic
	and ecological framework, 2) farmer's risk awareness and risk management
	measures, 3) grey energy in machines, buildings and external inputs,
	4) animal health and welfare. RISE has been tested and used to evaluate
	very different farms in Brazil, Canada, China and Switzerland. Results
	are considered relevant with regard to the objective stated. Further
	testing, adaptation and fine-tuning is under way. A similar model
	covering the supply chain to the factory gate is also under development.},

	two main paradigms: the deterministic, nonparametric Data Envelopment
	Analysis (DEA) and the parametric Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA).
	This paper examines an encompassing semiparametric frontier model
	that combines the DEA-type nonparametric frontier, which satisfies
	monotonicity and concavity, with the SFA-style stochastic homoskedastic
	composite error term. To estimate this model, a new two-stage method
	is proposed, referred to as Stochastic Non-smooth Envelopment of
	Data (StoNED). The first stage of the StoNED method applies convex
	nonparametric least squares (CNLS) to estimate the shape of the frontier
	without any assumptions about its functional form or smoothness.
	In the second stage, the conditional expectations of inefficiency
	are estimated based on the CNLS residuals, using the method of moments
	or pseudolikelihood techniques. Although in a cross-sectional setting
	distinguishing inefficiency from noise in general requires distributional
	assumptions, we also show how these can be relaxed in our approach
	if panel data are available. Performance of the StoNED method is
	examined using Monte Carlo simulations.},

	using a methodological approach that combines data envelopment analysis
	(DEA) and multicriteria decision making (MCDM) methods, and assigns
	common weights to each individual sustainability indicator. This
	approach is applied to a database of 163 farms located in the Campos
	County, a region belonging to the dry lands of the Spanish Northern
	Plateau, using 12 individual indicators of sustainability. Our findings
	show that both economic and environmental composite sustainability
	indicators are positively correlated, but that this is not the case
	for the social indicator. We also check the influence of a set of
	variables on farm sustainability using bootstrapping statistical
	techniques, and showing that increasing farm size, membership in
	agricultural cooperatives and farmersï¿½ medium and upper agricultural-specific
	technical education, all exert a significant positive influence on
	sustainability. These results provide clues for policy makers that
	intend to design sustainability-increasing structural agricultural
