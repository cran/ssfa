Description: Spatial Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SSFA) is an original method for controlling the spatial heterogeneity in Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) models by splitting the inefficiency term into three terms: the first one related to spatial peculiarities of the territory in which each single unit operates, the second one related to the specific production features and the third one representing the error term.
